### Sound Design Techniques Used

The realistic instruments use professional synthesis techniques:

- **Inharmonic Partials** - Bars and strings have non-integer partial ratios
- **Formant Filtering** - Multiple resonant filters simulate body resonances
- **Attack Transients** - Noise bursts and envelope shaping for realistic attacks
- **Delayed Vibrato** - Vibrato fades in after attack, like real players
- **Pickup Simulation** - Position-dependent filtering for electric instruments
- **Tube Saturation** - Soft clipping (tanh) for amp modeling
- **Mute Simulations** - Different resonant characteristics for muted brass
- **Body Resonance** - Multiple formant frequencies for acoustic bodies

## Usage

Each synthdef is self-contained in its own `.vibe` file. To use a sound in your composition:

```rhai
// Include the synthdef you want to use
// (Note: You'll need to manually include these files or create an import system)

// Then use it in your music
let kick = voice("kick")
    .synth("kick_808")
    .gain(db(0));

pattern("beat")
    .on(kick)
    .step("x...x...x...x...")
    .len(4.0)
    .start();
```

### Bulk Imports

To speed up prototyping you can now import ready-made indexes instead of referencing every instrument manually:

- `import "stdlib/index.vibe";` – load every instrument category plus the entire effects suite
- `import "stdlib/bass/index.vibe";` – load all bass synthdefs
- `import "stdlib/drums/index.vibe";` – load the complete drum kit
- `import "stdlib/leads/index.vibe";` – load all lead sounds
- `import "stdlib/pads/index.vibe";` – load both ambient and lush pads
- `import "stdlib/textures/index.vibe";` – load textures and drones
- `import "stdlib/fx/index.vibe";` – load risers, impacts, sweeps, and sub drops
- `import "stdlib/effects/index.vibe";` (or the legacy `all_effects.vibe`) – load every standard effect
- `import "stdlib/keys/index.vibe";` – load keyboards, pianos, and mallet instruments
- `import "stdlib/strings/index.vibe";` – load string instruments including guitars and bass
- `import "stdlib/brass/index.vibe";` – load all brass instruments
- `import "stdlib/woodwinds/index.vibe";` – load all woodwind instruments

Use these when you want fast access to the whole arsenal, and fall back to per-file imports if you need finer control over load time.

## Sound Design Principles

All sounds in this library follow professional sound design principles:

- **Kicks**: Pitch envelope on sine oscillators, noise for attack definition
- **Snares**: Filtered noise + tonal components
- **Hihats**: High-passed noise with short envelopes
- **Bass**: Layer oscillators, use filter modulation
- **Leads**: Detuning, filter sweeps, PWM for movement
- **Pads**: Multiple detuned oscillators, slow envelopes
- **FX**: Envelope-controlled filters and pitch
- **Textures**: Slow evolution, layered elements
